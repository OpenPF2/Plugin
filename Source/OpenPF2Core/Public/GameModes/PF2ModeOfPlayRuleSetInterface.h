 * An interface for OpenPF2-compatible Mode of Play Rule Sets (MoPRS), which provide strategies for the game should
 * behave while in a particular mode of PF2 play.
 *
 * MoPRS not only provide logic that control how different gameplay events are handled, but also can act as an extension
 * to game state by storing and maintaining variables that are relevant for the current mode of play. For example,
 * encounter modes maintain initiative order, number of enemies left standing, etc. which are not relevant in other game
 * modes like exploration mode. A new MoPRS instance is created each time that the mode of play changes, so this state
 * is only maintained while it is relevant.

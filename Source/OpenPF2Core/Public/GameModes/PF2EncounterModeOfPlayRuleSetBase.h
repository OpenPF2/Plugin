/**
 * Base class for PF2 Mode of Play Rule Sets (MoPRS) that need encounter logic, including initiative and queued actions.
 *
 * Encounters often involve each character "rolling" for their initiative order, and then performing attacks in order
 * from highest to lowest initiative score. This class provides several convenience methods for Blueprint sub-classes to
 * set initiatives for characters and then iterate through characters in order of their initiative.
 *
 * Since OpenPF2 is intended to support action RPGs just as well as turn-based RPGs, this base class also provides
 * convenience methods to support the ability for characters to "queue-up" abilities/actions that they want to perform
 * when it is their turn. This gives Blueprint sub-classes full control over how they want to implement combat, either
 * allowing each character to act one-by-one; or, cycling through characters at a rapid clip to keep combat flowing
 * despite the turn-based nature of PF2 rules.

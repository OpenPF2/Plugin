 * An interface for OpenPF2-compatible Game States.
 *
 * Game States track information that satisfies the following criteria:
 *   1. Relevant to all players in the same level (e.g., timers, team scores, mode of play).
 *   2. Not specific to any particular character. It should still be valid and relevant even if a player joins or
 *      leaves in the middle of the game. Information tied to a specific character (such as health or stats) should not
 *      be tracked here; it should instead be kept in Player State.
 *   3. Varies throughout gameplay, rather than being constant for the entire session/level. Static information that
 *      only varies level-to-level should be tracked by the Game Mode.

	 * equal 1 Bulk [...] A character becomes encumbered if they carry Bulk greater than 5 + their Str modifier, and
	 * they can't carry more than 10 + their Str modifier."
	 *
	 * From the Pathfinder 2E Core Rulebook, page 271-272, "Bulk":
	 * "Carrying especially heavy or unwieldy items can make it more difficult for you to move, as can overloading
	 * yourself with too much gear. The Bulk value of an item reflects how difficult the item is to handle,
	 * representing its size, weight, and general awkwardness. If you have a high Strength score, you usually don't need
	 * to worry about Bulk unless you're carrying numerous substantial items."
	 *
	 * From the Pathfinder 2E Core Rulebook, page 272, "Bulk Values":
	 * "Items can have a number to indicate their Bulk value, or they can be light (indicated by an L) or negligible
	 * (indicated by a —) for the purpose of determining Bulk. For instance, full plate armor is 4 Bulk, a longsword is
	 * 1 Bulk, a dagger or scroll is light, and a piece of chalk is negligible. Ten light items count as 1 Bulk, and you
	 * round down fractions (so 9 light items count as 0 Bulk, and 11 light items count as 1 Bulk). Items of negligible
	 * Bulk don't count toward Bulk unless you try to carry vast numbers of them, as determined by the GM."
	 *
	 * In OpenPF2, the following Bulk values correspond to special values from the Pathfinder 2E Core Rulebook:
	 *	- "0.01" corresponds to "negligible" (—) bulk.
	 *	- "0.10" corresponds to "light" (L) bulk.

	 * second to retrieve, nock, and loose an arrow. This means you can do things with your free hand while holding the
	 * bow without changing your grip, but the other hand must be free when you shoot. To properly wield a 1+ weapon,
	 * you must hold it in one hand and also have a hand free.
	 *
	 * Weapons requiring two hands typically deal more damage. Some one-handed weapons have the two-hand trait, causing
	 * them to deal a different size of weapon damage die when used in two hands. In addition, some abilities require
	 * you to wield a weapon in two hands. You meet this requirement while holding the weapon in two hands, even if it

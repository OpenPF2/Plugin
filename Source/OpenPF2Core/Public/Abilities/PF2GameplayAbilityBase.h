/**
 * Abstract base class for OpenPF2-enabled gameplay abilities.
 *
 * GAs that extend from this base class automatically get ability queuing and de-queuing interactions for free.
 * If a GA supports waiting for initiative (i.e., action queueing while in an encounter), then this ability must be
 * instanced (instancing is required for ability tasks to work). It should additionally be configured as follows:
 * - If bShouldBlockWhenQueued is false, then the GA should be instanced per activation. Otherwise, the ability will
 *   still block.
 * - If bShouldBlockWhenQueued is true, then the GA can be instanced per actor or instanced per activation, since only
 *   one instance of it can be queued/active at a time per actor.

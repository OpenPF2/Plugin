/**
 * An interface for OpenPF2-compatible Ability System Components.
 *
 * This interface extends ASCs to support additional, dynamic logic for adding and removing passive GEs and replicated
 * tags, which are commonly generated from settings added to characters and other objects that have an ASC by game
 * designers using Blueprint.
 *
 * Epic places logic like this on the character base object, but that isn't the ideal place because the logic has to
 * interact closely with the ASC on the character to have an effect. So, in OpenPF2, that logic lives in ASCs instead to
 * cut down on the number of concerns character base classes are managing.

// === Blinded
UE_DEFINE_GAMEPLAY_TAG_COMMENT(
	Pf2TagTraitConditionBlinded,
	"PF2.Trait.Condition.Blinded",
	"You can't see. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to you. You can't detect anything using vision. You are immune to visual effects. Blinded overrides dazzled."
)

// === Broken
UE_DEFINE_GAMEPLAY_TAG_COMMENT(
	Pf2TagTraitConditionBroken,
	"PF2.Trait.Condition.Broken",
	"Broken is a condition that affects objects. A broken object can't be used for its normal function, nor does it grant bonuses—with the exception of armor. A broken item still imposes penalties and limitations normally incurred by carrying, holding, or wearing it."
)

// === Clumsy
UE_DEFINE_GAMEPLAY_TAG_COMMENT(
	Pf2TagTraitConditionClumsy,

UE_DEFINE_GAMEPLAY_TAG_COMMENT(
	Pf2TagTraitConditionConcealed,
	"PF2.Trait.Condition.Concealed",

)

// === Confused
UE_DEFINE_GAMEPLAY_TAG_COMMENT(
	Pf2TagTraitConditionConfused,
	"PF2.Trait.Condition.Confused",
	"You don't have your wits about you, and you attack wildly. You are flat-footed, you don't treat anyone as your ally (though they might still treat you as theirs), and you can't Delay, Ready, or use reactions."
)

// === Controlled
UE_DEFINE_GAMEPLAY_TAG_COMMENT(
	Pf2TagTraitConditionControlled,

UE_DEFINE_GAMEPLAY_TAG_COMMENT(

// === Frightened
UE_DEFINE_GAMEPLAY_TAG_COMMENT(

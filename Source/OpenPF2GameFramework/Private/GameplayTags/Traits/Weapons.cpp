	"PF2.Trait.Weapon.Disarm",
	"A weapon with this trait allows a character to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if the character doesn't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from the character's own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If a character critically fails a check to Disarm using the weapon, they can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, they still need a free hand if they want to take the item."

The character can use the hand covered by the free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform manipulate actions, and so on. They can't attack with a free-hand weapon if they're wielding anything in that hand or otherwise using that hand. When they're not wielding anything and not otherwise using the hand, they can use abilities that require them to have a hand free as well as those that require them to be wielding a weapon in that hand. Each of their hands can have only one free-hand weapon on it."

When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it uses a range increment of 3 meters. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment in the weapon's Range entry."

UE_DEFINE_GAMEPLAY_TAG_COMMENT(
	Pf2TagTraitWeaponUnarmed,
	"PF2.Trait.Weapon.Unarmed",
	"An unarmed attack uses a character's body rather than a manufactured weapon. An unarmed attack isn't a weapon, though it's categorized with weapons for weapon groups, and it might have weapon traits. Since it's part of a character's body, an unarmed attack can't be Disarmed. It also doesn't take up a hand, though a fist or other grasping appendage generally works like a free-hand weapon."

// Spellcasting Ability - The key ability of a character/creature that can cast spells.
// =====================================================================================================================
// The classes in the core rulebook don't have any spellcasting abilities other than Wisdom and Charisma, but there's no
// reason to limit game makers to just those options. Plus, add-on material for OpenPF2 could always invent a new class
// that uses something like Intelligence for a character that does complex spellcasting or Dexterity for a character who
// performs physically-dexterous spells.

/**
 * Base class for a Gameplay Ability that gives the player the option to boost one or more character abilities.
 *
 * Each sub-class/instance of this class represents ability boosts that are coming from a single source (ancestry,
 * background, class, etc.) at a specific point in time. As such, when this ability is invoked by the player, care must
 * be taken to ensure that the same ability is not boosted more than once per activation.
 *
 * From the Pathfinder 2E Core Rulebook, page 20, "Ability Boosts":
 * "When your character receives an ability boost, the rules indicate whether it must be applied to a specific
 * ability score or to one of two specific ability scores, or whether it is a 'free' ability boost that can be
 * applied to any ability score of your choice. However, when you gain multiple ability boosts at the same time, you
 * must apply each one to a different score."
